# OptimalTransport
Computation of optimal transport dynamics of an overdamped Brownian particle.
For given initial and final distributions, the code plots the optimal transport dynamics.
The code also plots the optimal potential dynamics that realize the optimal transport dynamics for a given protocol time (tau) and friction coefficient (gamma).
See https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01200 for details.
